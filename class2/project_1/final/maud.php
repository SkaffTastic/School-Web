	<h1> Andrea Anders & Octopussy </h1>
	<h2> Man with the Golden Gun (Andrea Anders)</h2>
	
	<p>At the start of the film Anders is seen with Francisco Scaramanga on his private island. After the pre-title sequence, the plot for the story becomes clear. James Bond has been sent a note from Scaramanga, a famous assassin, with a golden bullet engraved with 007. As the plot unfolds it becomes clear that Miss Anders sent the note and the bullet hoping Bond would come and eventually kill Scaramanga.</p>
	
	<h2> Octopussy (Octopussy) </h2>
	
	<p>Octopussy is a jewel smuggler who lives a life of luxury. Her father studied octopi, hence the nickname Octopussy; her real name is unknown. Octopussy owns her own circus and floating palace in which she lives. Magda, the ring leader of the circus, works with her and, together, they work with Kamal Khan to get a Faberge egg from General Orlov. </p>
