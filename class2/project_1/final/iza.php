	<p> Natalya Simonova works as a Level 2 programmer at the Severnaya facility, on work involving missile guidance systems. When the treasonous General Ouromov and Xenia Onatopp attack the station with a stolen Tiger helicopter, she is left the only survivor besides Boris Grishenko, who had allied himself with Ourumov and Alec Trevelyan, the plan's mastermind. </p>
