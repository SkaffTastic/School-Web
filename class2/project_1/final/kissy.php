	<p> Bond, going undercover as a Japanese fisherman, marries Kissy in an arranged ceremony in order to better establish his cover. In the film, Bond and Kissy use their cover to investigate a nearby island where the evil organization SPECTRE and its leader, Ernst Stavro Blofeld, plot to start World War III; in the novel, the target is a castle where Blofeld maintains a "suicide garden" where people come to die (whether they want to or not), and Bond is seeking revenge for the murder of his wife at the conclusion of the previous novel, On Her Majesty's Secret Service. In the film version, Bond and Kissy eventually find Blofeld's lair, hidden within a volcano; with Tanaka's help the trio overthrow Blofeld's lair adverting war. </p>
