	<h1> Jill Masterson </h1>
	<h2> Goldfinger </h2>
	
	<p> She is an intelligent and very beautiful woman who Bond thinks is too nice to be involved with Goldfinger. She enjoyed humiliating Goldfinger. She then gets into bed with Bond. They spent an afternoon together and expect to enjoy the anticipated sleepless night until Bond goes to the refrigerator for another bottle of champagne when someone knocks him out. Bond awakens later to find that Jill was painted entirely in gold. Goldfinger gets his revenge for the card game. </p>
